# paper-artificial-viscosity-entropy-stable-2025

This repository contains information and code to reproduce the results presented in the preprint "An artificial viscosity approach to high order entropy stable discontinuous Galerkin methods". 

You will need to first activate and instantiate the Julia package environment to run any code. These codes were tested on Julia 1.10.7. 

# Paper codes

The codes are listed in the order the corresponding figures appear in the preprint. 

* `spurious_nullspaces.jl`: computes and plots spurious null space modes of the 1D and 2D BR-1 gradients.
* `density_wave_2D_convergence.jl`: computes L2 errors and convergence rates for the 2D density wave. 
* `density_wave_over_time_1D.jl`: computes L2 error over time for the 1D density wave
* `linear_stability_1D.jl`: computes the Jacobian and spectra using ForwardDiff.jl of a linearization around the 1D density wave
* `entropyresidual_viscosity_2D_convergence.jl`: computes the maximum entropy residual and viscosity coefficient over a sequence of refined meshes. 
* `AV_1D.jl`: solver for the 1D modified Sod and Shu-Osher problems using artificial viscosity-based entropy stable DG.
* `flux_diff_1D.jl`: solver for the 1D modified Sod and Shu-Osher problems using flux differencing entropy stable DG formulations.
* `AV_2D.jl`: solver for the 2D Riemann problem and long-time Kelvin-Helmholtz instability using artificial viscosity-based entropy stable DG.

## Appendix codes
* `compare_1D_elementwise_subcell_AV.jl`: compares element-wise and subcell artificial viscosity coefficients for the Shu-Osher problem. 
* `entropy_correction_2D.jl`: implements a modified version of the local entropy correction term from Abgrall, Offner, and Ranocha 2018.
